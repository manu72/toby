## Features

- ðŸ¤– ChatGPT-like conversational UI
- ðŸ”„ Multiple model support:
  - OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (online)
  - Microsoft DialoGPT (local)
  - Dummy fallback model
- ðŸ’» Clean, responsive web interface
- ðŸš€ Easy to extend with new models
- ðŸ“± Mobile-friendly design

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask openai
   ```

3. (Optional) For local model support, install additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch
   ```

## Configuration

1. Set up your OpenAI API key (required for GPT-3.5-turbo):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. Select your preferred model from the dropdown menu and start chatting!

## Available Models

1. **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**

   - Requires valid OpenAI API key
   - Best quality responses
   - Internet connection required

2. **DialoGPT**

   - Local model, no API key required
   - Runs entirely on your machine
   - Requires additional dependencies

3. **Dummy**
   - Simple echo response
   - Used as fallback
   - No dependencies required

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py          # Main application file
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # Project documentation
```

## Customisation

The application is designed to be easily extensible. To add a new model:

1. Create a new chat function in `app.py`
2. Add the function to the `MODEL_FUNCTIONS` dictionary
3. The new model will automatically appear in the UI dropdown

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your OpenAI API key to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- The application runs in debug mode by default - disable this in production
